# Key Materials used in Workshop
Bandung, you guys are amazing. Thanks for the warm welcome, and I enjoyed working with all of you. I put together the following resources and hope they benefit you greatly!

## In-Classroom Report Development
The report we developed together in the class can be found in the directory. For convenience, I've knitted the `submission.Rmd` file to a HTML (`submission.html`). If you would like it in PDF or Word or any other format, open in RStudio and click on **knit** from the menu.

## Sample Report 
A sample report, `report_skeleton.pdf` can be found in the directory. You can use it as a reference as you develop your report.

## Sample Data
The sample data we've used (Wikipedia views) is stored in `data_input`

## Key Points
The 5 main points in developing your project (from reading data to model evaluation / diagnosis) is saved in `keypoints.md`

## Reference Diagram
Reference sheet for considerations when picking Machine Learning algorithms can be found in the `assets` folder.

- Considerations  
	- Interpretability  
	- Robustness  
	- Performance  
	- Willingness to make strong assumptions  
	- Speed and cost of integration
